     <section class="History of baking">
    <h2>A Brief History of Baking</h2>
    <p>Baking is one of the oldest culinary practices, dating back thousands of years. Evidence suggests that Egyptians were using yeast to leaven bread as early as 2600 BC. Over time, baking traditions spread throughout Europe and Asia, with regional variations emerging.</p>
    <p>The first bakers likely worked from home, selling their wares on the streets. Eventually, dedicated bakeries emerged, offering a wider variety of baked goods. Today, bakeries remain a beloved part of communities around the world, providing fresh bread, pastries, and other treats.</p>
